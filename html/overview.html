    <p id="para"> Nearly 900,000 U.S. workers filed for unemployment compensation last week, the highest weekly figure in nearly two months, the U.S. Labor Department reported Thursday, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the American labor market. The unemployment rate has remainde mostlsy steady since 1940. The unemployement rate has beenincreasing as the population gets higher. Certain events can cause the employment rate to fluctuate wildly. Such as the U.S. housing bubble burst. As seen in the graph the employment rate dropped down heavily. In more recent years COVID-19 has had a major impact on employment rates Unemployment Rate in the United States averaged 5.76 percent from 1948 until 2020, reaching an all time high of 14.70 percent in April of 2020 and a record low of 2.50 percent in May of 1953.

    <h2 id="header"> Does Education Matter? </h2>
    <p id="para"> According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, earnings increase and unemployment decreases as educational attainment rises. Grouping workers by education level, the chart shows that those with more education have higher earnings and lower rates of unemployment than those with less education. For example, workers with a professional degree had the highest median weekly earnings ($1,730) and lowest unemployment rate (1.5 percent) in 2015 of all groups shown. Thatâ€™s more than triple the earnings ($493) and less than one-fifth the unemployment rate (8.0 percent) of workers with less than a high school diploma.</p>
